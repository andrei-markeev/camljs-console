Some more usage notes
---------------------

At the moment, you cannot directly interact with the underlying SharePoint portal via the CamlJs code editor window, but otherwise, any valid JS code will be processed. E.g. you can use arrays, functions and so on:

Intellisense is enhanced with fields of the list, that you're querying against.
